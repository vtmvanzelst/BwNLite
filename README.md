# BwN Codebook
 Supporting software for Delft University of Technology Building with Nature course 2024-2025.


## Usage

For the design assignment we are making use of the hydrodynamic numerical model XBeach in combination with JupyterLite notebooks 
These scripts provide some basic functionality. Feel challenged to adapt/develop these scripts to retrieve better system understanding. 
Below we provide instructions on:
1. [JupyterLite Environment](https://github.com/vtmvanzelst/BwNCodebook#python-environment-and-downloading-assignment-files)
2. [Download and use of XBeach](https://github.com/vtmvanzelst/BwNCodebook#xbeach)

## Python Environment and downloading assignment files
Make a clone of this repository using GitHub Desktop and create a Python environment using a *.yaml-file to prevent dependencies issues by following the steps below.

### 1. GitHub Desktop client

By these steps, the files that are hosted at GitHub are "pulled" to your machine:
* 1.1 Download GitHub Desktop via (https://desktop.github.com/) and install on your computer.
* 1.2 Browse to (https://github.com/vtmvanzelst/BwNCodebook), click on the green "Code"
   		button and select "Open with GitHub Desktop", or paste the URL into the GitHub client.

### 2. Mamba package manager

If you're not familiar with managing Python environments, please have a look at this
[introduction](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/lectures/environment/python_environments.html?highlight=conda)
first. The bottom line is that it is good practice to manage your software environments
to avoid dependency conflicts.

Continue with installing a package manager (here we use Mambaforge):

#### Windows
1. Download the [Mambaforge](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) executable file for Windows from [Miniforge GitHub page](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge). On that page there are also binaries for Mac and Linux; and for `conda` package managers, so make sure you download
the `mambaforge` executable file for Windows. Install the executable by clicking on it; you can stay with the default settings by just clicking next through the installation client.

#### Mac and Linux

**We did not test XBeach on Mac. You can pre-process and post-process data in Python on your Mac, but we do not provide instructions on how to run XBeach on Mac.**

1. We recommend to install Mambaforge on Linux and Mac using a terminal. On Mac, you can
	   open a terminal by searching for "terminal" or "iterm". On Linux the hotkey to open a
	   terminal is "cntrl + shift + t". The commands to
	   install the package manager are copied from their documentation and can be run by
	   copying the commands below over to your terminal and pressing enter:  
	   ```
	   curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
	   bash Mambaforge-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
	   ```
2. Accept the user agreements, and allow the installation script to edit your profile
	   file. The profile file (`~/.bashrc` on Linux or possibly `~/.zshrc` on Mac) is the
	   first script which is being executed when you open a new terminal. The installation
	   script will add a few lines to that file to make the `mamba` command available every
	   time open a new terminal. 
3. Close the terminal.


## XBeach
XBeach is a two-dimensional model for wave propagation, long waves and mean flow, sediment transport and morphological change on the coastal nearshore area (Roelvink et al., 2009). 
It includes a vegetation module that solves short-wave and long-wave -vegetation interaction (Van Rooijen et al., 2015; Van Rooijen et al., 2016). 

* XBeach software can be downloaded at: 	(https://download.deltares.nl/xbeach)

* XBeach manual:				(https://xbeach.readthedocs.io/en/latest/xbeach_manual.html)

If multiple XBeach versions are downloaded. This assignment is tested for **2018-11-09_XBeach_v1.23.5527_XBeachX_x64_netcdf**.
